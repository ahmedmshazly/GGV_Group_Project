# GGV Group Project - Database Systems Course

## Overview
This repository hosts our summative project for the "Database Systems" course as part of the Computer Science Bachelor's degree program at The African Leadership University in Rwanda. The project focuses on the Global Green Visa (GGV) Project, an innovative mechanism designed for fund aggregation within the tourism sector to support environmental and social efforts.

---

## Team Composition
This project was a collaborative effort of five members, each contributing to various aspects such as SQL coding, design, testing, and deployment.

---

## My Contributions
- **Entities' Relationships Design**: Played a significant role in designing the relationships between entities using MySQL.
- **SQL Coding**: Actively involved in writing SQL code for some of the entities.

---

## Project Tasks
1. **Identifying Main Entities of GGV Project**: Analyzed the provided documents to determine the primary entities involved in the GGV Project.
2. **ER Diagram Development**: Created Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams to represent the relationships between the identified entities.
3. **Multiplicity/Cardinality Constraints**: Defined and represented the multiplicity (cardinality) constraints for each relationship in the ER diagrams.
4. **Attributes Identification**: Identified and associated attributes with entities or relationships, integrating them into the ER diagrams.
5. **Key Attributes Determination**: Determined candidate and primary key attributes for each strong entity.
6. **Comprehensive ER Diagram**: Utilized data modeling tools like Open Source Rational Rose or Diagrams.net to create a single, comprehensive ER diagram, including assumptions made during the design process.
7. **Database Implementation**: Implemented the design in MySQL DBMS, and saved the final structure of the ERD as a .pdf file. Also submitted the database from MySQL as a .sql file.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **MySQL**: Primary tool for database design and SQL coding.
- **Data Modeling Tools**: Used for creating ER diagrams (e.g., Diagrams.net, Rational Rose).

---

## Repository Contents
- ER Diagrams
- SQL Code Files
- PDF of Final ERD Structure
- .sql file of the MySQL Database

---

## Future Work
Further development might include refining the database structure based on evolving project requirements and continuous testing and deployment adjustments.
